I'm working on improving my design skills. The goal of this repo is to save my daily progress and also to showcase what I make. I'm currently using Sketch for graphic design.

I'm hoping to spend some time on this daily for the next few weeks (maybe months). This is where I'll be uploading designs.

Daily Updates:
- Day 1 (11/18/2015): Made a male character similar to something you might see in South Park

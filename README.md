I'm working on improving my design skills. The goal of this repo is to save my daily progress and also to showcase what I make. I'm currently using Sketch for graphic design.

I'm hoping to spend some time on this daily for the next few weeks (maybe months). This is where I'll be uploading designs.

Daily Updates:
- Day 1 (11/18/2015): Made a male character similar to something you might see in South Park
- Day 2 (11/19/2015): Spent a lot of time trying to first make hair, and then design a cap. After several failed attempts, I decided to just make something that looks like a Kippah/Taqiya.
- Day 3 (11/20/2015): Added some hair to the original character. Also added a female character.
- Day 4 (11/21/2015): Added adult characters similar to the older ones. Played around a bit with clothing and facial structure. 
- Day 5 (11/22/2015): Running low on time so I just added a simple headband on the young male character
